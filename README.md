Data Visualisation with leaflet

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of 
our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, 
relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. 
They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. 
In this challenge, we have been tasked with developing a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public 
and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Data Source: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

From the datasource, last 7 days earthquake data is collected and fed into Javascript file (static>JS). The output can be generated by running the index.html file. Snippet of leaflet is as below:
